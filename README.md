# zombie-day
Simple, text based game as part of JavaScript course at Medieinstitutet

The task has been to create a text-based interactive game with JavaScript, where the user can take decisions and either end up dead, alive or something in between.

Zombie Day takes the player along on a very special day, in a parallell universe, where everyone except for yourself turns into zombies for one day each year.
